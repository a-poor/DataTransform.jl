# DataTransform.jl

_created by Austin Poor_

This library is intended to help develop a standardized data-transformation schema for tabular data.

Data transformation files are defined in JSON so they are human-readable, trackable in VC, and so they can be passed between languages. `DataTransform`'s goal is to promote reproducablity and clean transformations (rather than hack-y fixes, whenever possible).

You pass in a rectangular dataset and define a stack of transformations to apply -- `DataTransform.jl` does the rest!
